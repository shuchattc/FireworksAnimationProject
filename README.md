# FireworksAnimationProject
Front End HTML, CSS, JS project to learn animation.
Project creates a canvas for the full window size and fills the whole canvas background black to simulate night sky. On click a function is triggered to draw and update 400 particles of varying colors to slowly descend in a radius simulating a firework.
